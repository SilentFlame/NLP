## Tokenizer ##
#### The content of the file are: ####
- Problem_statement file which will be having the problem statement which I'm trying to solve.
- Report file which contains the entire report I have prepared for this assignment.
- Script file which contains the script of the tokenizer which is the solution of the problem statement.
- Tokened_result is the file containing the final result output ie. the Tokened data.
- Twitter data that is used to generate the tokens.

-------------------------------------
### How to run ###
- Open your terminal prompt(use `ctrl + alt + T`).
- run `pyhton script.py`.
- remove the  `rokened_result.txt` file before running the script so as to observe the new file formation.
- keep the `twitter_data.txt` file in the same directory.
